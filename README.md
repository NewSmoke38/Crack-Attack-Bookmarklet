# 🌈 Rainbow Reader Bookmarklet

**Rainbow Reader** is here to add color to your life (and web pages)! One click and your boring text transforms into a neon explosion. 

## 💡 What Does It Do?

- **Rainbow Magic**: Makes your paragraphs pop with random neon colors.
- **Hover Glow**: Hover over text and see it *light up* like a retro arcade game.
- **Minimalistic (aka not annoying)**: Adds color without being overwhelming.

## 🌟 How to Use

### 1. **Drag the bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar:**

### 2. **Click it, sit back, and watch the rainbow magic unfold.**

> 💡 Works best on text-heavy pages like [History of the Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet)

## 🛠️ How it Works

It’s just some funky JavaScript that applies a bunch of random neon colors and a hover effect to paragraphs. No biggie.
